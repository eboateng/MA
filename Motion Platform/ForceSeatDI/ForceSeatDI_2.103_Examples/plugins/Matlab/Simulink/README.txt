SETUP:
- Add ForceSeatDI Simulink library directory (plugins/Matlab/Simulink) to Matlab paths (HOME -> ENVIRONMENT -> Set Path)
- Open provided example project and you are ready to go

RUNNING NEW EXAMPLES:
- ForceSeatDI blocks allow to drive platforms in the "real time"
- Simulation Pacing has to be defined to use them with Matlab Simulink 
- Open Simulation Pacing Options for your project
- Enable pacing to slow down simulation
- set simulation time per wall clock second to 1

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- MotionSystems ForceSeatDI is not visible in the Library Browser
	- make sure that library folder is added to the Matlab paths
	- try to refresh Library Browser by clicking F5 keyboard button
